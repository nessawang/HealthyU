# HealthyU

HealthyU is an application developed as part of my final project. It is designed to promote a state of being healthy, emphasizing the importance of family and friends in our lives and highlighting the significance of a healthy body for a fulfilling life.
The goal of HealthyU is to empower users in their health journey by leveraging data, machine learning, and interactive features. The application consists of two main parts: disease prediction and personalized recommendations.

## Disease Prediction
The first part of the app focuses on predicting the chances of developing common diseases based on various factors such as lifestyle choices, age, and underlying health conditions. By utilizing advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques, HealthyU can provide users with insights into their health risks. Initially, our focus is on three specific diseases: stroke, lung cancer, and diabetes. However, the application has the potential to expand its prediction capabilities to cover a broader range of common diseases.

## Personalized Recommendations
The second part of HealthyU offers personalized recommendations to help users maintain or improve their overall well-being. These recommendations are tailored to each individual's specific health profile and are based on the predictions made in the first part of the application. By analyzing the user's data and considering their health goals, HealthyU provides practical advice and guidance to support their health journey.
